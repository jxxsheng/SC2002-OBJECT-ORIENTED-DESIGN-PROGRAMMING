# SC2002 - Object Oriented Design & Programming

**Food Order Management System** (FOMS) is a Java console application that utilizes object-oriented concepts to efficiently manage streamlining the process of ordering, payment,
and order management for both customers and staff at Fastfood restaurants. The program is designed with a focus on reusability, extensibility, and maintainability, allowing for easy upgrades and future development. It provides flexibility to accommodate different user types and their requirements.
